# 🤖 AI Usage Policy

## 🔍 Purpose of the Policy

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools—such as language models, code generators, image analyzers, and virtual tutors—can be powerful supports for learning. However, when misused, they can hinder understanding and compromise academic integrity. This policy provides guidance on how you may and may not use AI tools in this course.

## ✅ **Permitted Uses of AI Tools**

You may use AI tools to support your learning in the following ways:

- **Understanding concepts**: You may use AI to clarify or rephrase ideas from lectures, textbooks, or assignments.
- **Studying terminology**: You may use AI to look up technical terms, definitions, or basic principles (e.g., "What are the applications of the Bayes theorem?" or "Explain the Nyquist theorem").
- **Generating practice material**: You may ask AI tools to help you quiz yourself or create practice problems.
- **Learning by example**: You may ask for general examples that help you better understand topics like digital signal processing, circuit analysis, or embedded systems.
- **Debugging support**: You may use AI tools to help interpret error messages or learn syntax—so long as the work remains your own.

---

## ❌ **Prohibited Uses of AI Tools**

You may **not** use AI tools in the following ways:

* **To generate solutions for assignments, labs, projects, or exams**: Do not submit any code, calculations, diagrams, or written responses that were produced wholly or partially by an AI system.

* **To rewrite AI-generated work to pass as original**: Rephrasing or editing AI output and submitting it as your own still constitutes unauthorized assistance.

* **To avoid doing your own analysis**: Submitting AI-generated responses without fully understanding them undermines your learning and violates academic expectations.

## 🎓 **Rationale Behind the Policy**

- **You’re here to learn**: Engineering courses are designed to build your problem-solving and critical thinking skills. AI shortcuts can prevent you from developing the abilities you'll need as a professional.

- **Integrity is essential**: Submitting work you didn't produce yourself—even if assisted by an AI—is a form of **academic dishonesty**, similar to plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration.

- **AI tools are not neutral**: While AI can explain topics, it can also make errors or generate misleading content. Relying on it too heavily can give you a false sense of understanding.

## ⚖️ **Consequences for Violating This Policy**

If you misuse AI tools in this course, you may face consequences including:

- Receiving a zero on the assignment or project
- Being reported for academic misconduct
- Further disciplinary actions under USAFA academic integrity policy

---

## 💬 **If You’re Unsure**

If you're unsure whether your use of AI is appropriate, ask the instructor **before using it**. If you wouldn’t be comfortable explaining your process in front of the class, it’s probably not within policy.

---

## ✅ **How to Use AI Tools Responsibly**

Use AI as a support, not a shortcut:

- Treat it like a tutor, not a teammate.
- Ask it to help you **understand** the “why” or “how”—not to **do** the work for you.
- Verify everything it tells you against your notes, textbook, or instructor guidance.
- Keep notes on how you use AI while studying, in case you need to explain your process.

## 🧠 Final Words

AI will be a tool in your future engineering career—but learning to **use it responsibly and ethically** is essential. This course supports your growth, and that means **doing the hard work yourself** when it matters.

Let’s use technology wisely—with integrity, curiosity, and responsibility.
