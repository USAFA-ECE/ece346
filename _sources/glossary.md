## Glossary of Logical Terms

### Proposition
A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either *true* or *false*, but not both. It makes an assertion about reality and can be evaluated for truth. The linguistic form (English, math symbols, etc.) doesn‚Äôt matter; what matters is whether the content has a definite truth value.

**Examples:**
- "The Earth orbits the Sun" is a proposition because it can be evaluated as true.
- "The Moon is made of cheese." (False)
- "2 + 2 = 4" (True)

#### Compound Proposition
A **compound proposition** is a logical statement formed by combining two or more **simple propositions** using logical connectives such as **and (‚àß)**, **or (‚à®)**, **not (¬¨)**, **if...then (‚Üí)**, and **if and only if (‚Üî)**. It expresses a more complex relationship between truth values.

**Examples:**
- "The Earth orbits the Sun **and** 2 + 2 = 4" ‚Äî combines two true propositions using ‚àß.
- "If it rains, then the ground gets wet" ‚Äî implication using ‚Üí.
- "Either the Moon is made of cheese **or** pigs can fly" ‚Äî disjunction using ‚à®.

#### Simple (Non-Compound) Proposition
A **simple proposition** is a single declarative statement that does **not** contain any logical connectives. It stands alone and can be evaluated as either *true* or *false*.

**Examples:**
- "The Earth orbits the Sun" ‚Äî true
- "The Moon is made of cheese" ‚Äî false
- "2 + 2 = 4" ‚Äî true

### Propositional Function

A **propositional function** is a statement containing one or more variables that becomes a **proposition** once specific values are substituted for those variables. Until the variables are assigned, the statement is neither true nor false.

**Examples:**

* $P(x):\; x > 5$ ‚Äî not a proposition until $x$ is given a value.
* If $x = 7$, then $P(7): 7 > 5$ is **true**.
* If $x = 3$, then $P(3): 3 > 5$ is **false**.
* $Q(x,y):\; x + y = 10$ ‚Äî becomes a proposition once values of $x$ and $y$ are specified.

### Predicate
A **predicate** is essentially the property or relation expressed in a propositional function. In logic, it acts as a function that returns a truth value when applied to one or more subjects. Predicates are the building blocks of propositional functions. In practice, propositional functions and predicates often look the same (P(x), Q(x,y)), but **predicate** emphasizes the meaning (the property/relationship), while **propositional function** emphasizes the form (a function that turns into a proposition when variables are instantiated).


**Examples:**
- In "Socrates is mortal", "is mortal" is the predicate and "Socrates" is the subject. In predicate logic: Mortal(x) 
- IsTall(x): "x is tall"
- Loves(x, y): "x loves y"
- Prime(n): "n is a prime number"

### Premise
In mathematics, a premise is often called a **hypothesis**. In a conditional statement ("If p, then q"), the **antecedent** (the "if" part) is a specific type of premise. Thus, every antecedent is a premise, but not every premise is an antecedent.

**Examples:**
- "All mammals are warm-blooded."
- "If it rains, the ground gets wet."
- "Jane is taller than Tom."

---

### Conclusion
A **conclusion** is the proposition that is supported or proven by the premises in an argument.  In a conditional statement ("If p, then q"), the consequence (the "then" part) corresponds to the conclusion of that conditional. Thus, every consequence is a conclusion, but not every conclusion is a consequence.

**Examples:**
- "Therefore, the Earth is round." (based on previous evidence/premises)
- "Hence, she must be at home."
- "It follows that all bachelors are unmarried."

---

### Argument
An **argument** is a group of propositions in which some (premises) are intended to support another (conclusion). It's the fundamental structure of reasoning.

**Example:**
   - Premise: All birds have feathers.  
   - Premise: A sparrow is a bird.  
   - Conclusion: Therefore, a sparrow has feathers.

**Example:**
   - Premise: If you study, you will pass.  
   - Premise: You studied.  
   - Conclusion: Therefore, you will pass.

---

### Inference (Reasoning)
**Inference**, or **reasoning**, is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises or known facts.

**Examples:**
- From "All dogs bark" and "Rex is a dog," we infer "Rex barks."
- From "If the light is red, stop" and "The light is red," infer "Stop."
- From "All metals conduct electricity" and "Copper is a metal," infer "Copper conducts electricity."

---

### Validity (Valid)
An argument is **valid** if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Validity is about form, not the actual truth of the statements.

**Examples:**
1.  
   - Premise: All cats are animals.  
   - Premise: Felix is a cat.  
   - Conclusion: Felix is an animal. ‚úÖ Valid

2.  
   - Premise: All unicorns are reptiles.  
   - Premise: Bob is a unicorn.  
   - Conclusion: Bob is a reptile. ‚úÖ Valid (though premises are false)

3.  
   - Premise: Some dogs are brown.  
   - Premise: Rex is brown.  
   - Conclusion: Rex is a dog. ‚ùå Invalid (conclusion doesn't logically follow)

### Converse

The **converse** of a conditional proposition $p \to q$ is the statement $q \to p$. It is formed by **swapping** the hypothesis and the conclusion.
The converse is **not** logically equivalent to the original statement in general.

**Examples:**

* Original: "If it rains, then the ground gets wet." ($p \to q$)
* Converse: "If the ground gets wet, then it rains." ($q \to p$) ‚Äî This is not always true (sprinklers, for example).

---

### Contrapositive

The **contrapositive** of a conditional proposition $p \to q$ is the statement $\sim q \to \sim p$. It is formed by **swapping** and **negating** both the hypothesis and the conclusion.
The contrapositive **is logically equivalent** to the original statement.

**Examples:**

* Original: "If it rains, then the ground gets wet." ($p \to q$)
* Contrapositive: "If the ground does not get wet, then it did not rain." ($\sim q \to \sim p$) ‚Äî Always true if the original is true.

---

### Inverse

The **inverse** of a conditional proposition $p \to q$ is the statement $\sim p \to \sim q$. It is formed by **negating** both the hypothesis and the conclusion without swapping them.
The inverse is **not** logically equivalent to the original statement in general.

**Examples:**

* Original: "If it rains, then the ground gets wet." ($p \to q$)
* Inverse: "If it does not rain, then the ground does not get wet." ($\sim p \to \sim q$) ‚Äî Not always true (sprinklers again).

## Glossary of Proof-Related Terms

### Theorem
A **theorem** is a mathematical or logical statement that has been proven to be true based on previously established statements such as axioms, definitions, and earlier theorems.

**Examples:**
- Pythagorean Theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- G√∂del‚Äôs Incompleteness Theorems

---

### Proposition (in proof context)
A **proposition** in the context of proofs is a statement that is proved true using logic and previously proven statements. It is often considered less central or less important than a theorem.

**Examples:**
- In some texts, a small result that is still worth proving may be called a proposition.
- "Every finite group of prime order is cyclic."

---

### Proof
A **proof** is a logical argument demonstrating the truth of a theorem or proposition, using deductive reasoning from accepted premises, axioms, and previously established results.

**Examples:**
- A direct proof using definitions and logical steps.
- A proof by contradiction assuming the opposite and deriving a contradiction.
- An inductive proof involving base cases and inductive steps.

---

### Axiom
An **axiom** (or **postulate**) is a self-evident or universally accepted principle that does not require proof. It serves as a starting point for logical or mathematical reasoning.

**Examples:**
- In geometry: "Through any two points, there exists exactly one line."
- In arithmetic: "For any number \( a \), \( a + 0 = a \)."
- In set theory: "Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements."

---

### Lemma
A **lemma** is a proven statement used as a stepping stone to prove a larger result (typically a theorem). While it may be useful in its own right, its main role is as a helper theorem.

**Examples:**
- Euclid‚Äôs Lemma: If a prime divides a product, it divides at least one factor.
- Schwarz‚Äôs Lemma in complex analysis.

---

### Corollary
A **corollary** is a statement that follows readily and with little or no additional proof from a previously proven theorem or proposition.

**Examples:**
- Corollary to the Pythagorean Theorem: If two sides of a triangle are perpendicular, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
- Corollary: Every finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic.

---

### Conjecture
A **conjecture** is a statement that is believed to be true based on observations or evidence but has not yet been proven or disproven.

**Examples:**
- Goldbach‚Äôs Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
- Collatz Conjecture
- Twin Prime Conjecture
